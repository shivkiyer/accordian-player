## An interactive video player

This app hosts an online video player with the usual video controls, but can also receive inputs from a user on their viewing preferences and generate a custom video playlist.

The video player can be used in any application that features significant amount of video content all of which an average user may not find interesting. Instead of losing the interest of the viewer or expecting them to fast forward the video, the accordian player provides options to the user asking them for their preferences, and according to those preferences, plays them a selected set of videos.

The creator of the videos can configure these options using a template which is then inserted into a Comma Separated Values (.csv) file. The config file can be found along with the video files on any online hosting.

The app is currently being built using React 18. This is to ensure that it can be embedded into larger apps that could utilize an interactive video player.
